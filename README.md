# SignAnti: Anti-Gravity AI Sign Language System

> **Vision**: A futuristic anti-gravity environment where communication has no barriers.

## 🌌 Project Concept
A real-time AI-based sign language recognition system that enables seamless communication between hearing-impaired and non-hearing individuals. The system functions within a metaphorical "anti-gravity" environment—symbolizing the removal of the "weight" of communication barriers.

**The Anti-Gravity Justification:**
> "The anti-gravity environment represents the removal of physical and communication barriers, while the system demonstrates real-time conversion of commonly used sign language sentences into voice using AI."

## 🚀 Key Features (Conceptual & Prototype)

The system visualizes a world where AI detects gestures in real-time and converts them into:
1.  **Holographic Text**: Glowing, futuristic overlays of the spoken words.
2.  **Natural Voice**: Human-like speech synthesis.
3.  **Zero-Gravity UI**: A floating, accessible interface designed for inclusivity.

### Supported Expressions (Vision Scope)
The project aims to facilitate daily life communication, targeting expressions such as:
- **Greetings**: "Hello, how are you?", "Good morning", "Nice to meet you".
- **Needs**: "I am hungry", "I need water", "Please help me".
- **Emotions**: "I am happy today", "I am excited", "I love you".
- **Social**: "Yes, I agree", "No, I don't agree", "Call me later".
- **Tech Advocacy**: "Technology should be accessible to everyone", "AI makes the world more inclusive".

*(Note: The current functional prototype demonstrates core recognition for: Hello, Peace, Yes, No, Pointing, OK, and I Love You).*

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Neon/Glassmorphism), JavaScript
- **AI/Vision**: Google MediaPipe Hands (Real-time tracking of 21 hand landmarks)
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (Text-to-Speech)
- **Environment**: Standalone Browser Application (No installation required)

## 📥 Usage (Prototype)
1.  Open `standalone.html`.
2.  Grant Camera Permissions.
3.  Perform gestures to see the AI Translation in action.
